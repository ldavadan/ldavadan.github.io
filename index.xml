      <description>The API has 20 years of records of weather data. When you need some data, you have to use the API to load them.
For my first exercise, I had to give an usable file with data about the relative humidity throughout the year near to Frasnes-lez-Anvaing.
Find the nearest station Fisrt, I checked where was Frasnes-lez-Anvaing on the platform to find the nearest station.</description>

      <description>In the course of my studies in Bordeaux Sciences Agro, I realised a 3-month internship. This internship took place in the Walloon agricultural research centre (CRA-W)) from May 22nd to August 20th 2018. I made a contribution to the AGROMET project in Farming Systems, Territory and Information Technologies Unit. The aim of the Agromet project is to provide a near real-time hourly gridded datasets of weather parameters at the resolution of 1 km² for the whole region of Wallonia characterized by a quality indicator.</description>

      <description>This post will sum up a few sources of information useful if you are interested in spatialization or development.
Spatialization Definition : Spatialization or spatial interpolation creates a continuous surface from values measured at discrete locations to predict values at any location in the interest zone with the best accuracy.
The book Using ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst will give you an efficient overview about spatialization.
The book Geocomputation with R will give you a lot of informations about what you can do with geographic data.</description>

      <title>Using AGROMET API to get weather data</title>

      <description>An API (Application Programming Interface) allows connections to be established between several software programs to exchange data. It needs the authentification of the user with a API key or token. Storing the API key in a script enables to call it in other commands to modify the files of the API. This token will not be available for other users, avoiding in that way an abusive use of this key by others.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal blog made for my internship in CRA-W.
I&amp;rsquo;m a student from Bordeaux Sciences Agro and I&amp;rsquo;m doing an internship in the Walloon agricultural centre of research. I participate in the AGROMET project which aims to provide a near real-time hourly gridded datasets of weather parameters at the resolution of 1 km² for the whole region of Wallonia characterized by a quality indicator.</description>
