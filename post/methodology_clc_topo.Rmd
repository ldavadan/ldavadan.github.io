In the context of the AGROMET project, we need CORINE land cover data and digital terrain model to improve models.

I refer you to my other posts about CORINE land cover (CLC) :

* How to [get CLC data from Wallonia](https://ldavadan.github.io/post/get_corinelc_wallonia/)

* Solve a problem in [computing the area of each polygon inside a buffer](https://ldavadan.github.io/post/solve_pb_clc/)

This post deals with the methodology which was applied to prepare data before using them in our models.

# CLC

First, I was focused on CORINE land cover data. My work has two parts :

* A part about physical stations, i.e. stations from PAMESEB network where data are available

* Another part on the grid of Wallonia with virtual stations (one for each km²)

## Physical stations

The methodology was described in [this post](https://ldavadan.github.io/post/get_corinelc_wallonia/).

<insert map with buffer around stations>

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(mapview)
mapview(stations.buff.sf)
```

## Virtual stations

Different methods were used to observe CORINE land cover near to each virtual station.

First, a grid of Wallonia with cells of 1km² has been created. It is a simple feature `sf`.

### Using centroid of each cell and creating a buffer around

I refer you to the bottom of [this page](https://ldavadan.github.io/post/get_corinelc_wallonia/) where I have already explained the method.

The limit of this method is that we have a loss of information between every virtual station with gap in the map. That is an important problem for the future predictions.

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(class.buff.clean.df)
```

### Using entire cell

This time, I will use all the cell and not only its centroid.

The method was close to the precedent one with buffers but I will have no gap in my map.

I used simple features `sf` for computations but I had a problem with the function `st_intersection()`. Indeed, an error appeared : 

`Error in CPL_geos_op2(op, st_geometry(x), st_geometry(y)) : TopologyException: Input geom 1 is invalid: Ring Self-intersection at or near point [coordinates of the point]`. 

After a long investigation, the solution we found was to install a new package : `lwgeom` to use a function which works with `st_intersection()`. Then, the issue was solved.
